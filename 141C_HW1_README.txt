For the first 4 problems, run with python2.7 instead of python, example:
python2.7 problem3.py training.csv 0.1

For problem 5, the shell script is called with: 
./problem5.sh [problem to run (3 or 4)] [training or validation] [thr thr ... thr]
For example:
./problem5.sh problem3.py training.csv 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.8 1.0
Note: It is very slow
